# Assignment 6: Agile User Stories, Backlog, and Sprint Planning

## Overview
This repository contains the Agile planning documentation for the AI-Powered Smart Appointment Booking System, continuing from the requirements (Assignment 4) and use cases (Assignment 5). The documentation follows Agile methodology by translating system requirements into user stories, creating a prioritized product backlog, and planning an initial sprint.

## Repository Structure

- **[user_stories.md](user_stories.md)**: Contains 15 user stories derived from functional requirements and use cases, following the format "As a [role], I want [action] so that [benefit]" with acceptance criteria and priorities.

- **[product_backlog.md](product_backlog.md)**: Presents a prioritized backlog using MoSCoW prioritization (Must-have, Should-have, Could-have, Won't-have) with effort estimates and dependencies.

- **[sprint_planning.md](sprint_planning.md)**: Details the first 2-week sprint plan with a clear sprint goal, selected user stories, and a breakdown of tasks with assignments and hour estimates.

- **[agile_reflection.md](agile_reflection.md)**: A 500-word reflection on the challenges encountered in prioritization, estimation, and aligning Agile with stakeholder needs.

- **Previous Assignment Files**:
  - [use_case_explanation.md](use_case_explanation.md)
  - [use_case_specifications.md](use_case_specifications.md)
  - [test_cases.md](test_cases.md)
  - [reflection.md](reflection.md)

## Assignment Requirements Fulfilled

1. **User Story Creation (30 Marks)**
   - Created 15 user stories (exceeding the required 8+)
   - Used the format: "As a [role], I want [action] so that [benefit]"
   - Included acceptance criteria for each story
   - Assigned priority levels (High/Medium/Low)

2. **Product Backlog Creation (30 Marks)**
   - Compiled user stories into a prioritized product backlog
   - Used MoSCoW prioritization
   - Included effort estimates (1-5 scale)
   - Documented dependencies between stories
   - Provided justification for prioritization decisions

3. **Sprint Planning (30 Marks)**
   - Defined a clear 2-week sprint goal
   - Selected 5 user stories from the backlog for the sprint
   - Broke stories into 15 detailed tasks
   - Assigned tasks to team members with hour estimates
   - Explained how the sprint contributes to the MVP

4. **Documentation & Clarity (10 Marks)**
   - Compiled all artifacts into a structured repository
   - Ensured traceability to prior assignments
   - Provided clear documentation with consistent formatting

## Next Steps for GitHub Integration

To fully implement the GitHub Issues and Projects requirement:

1. Create GitHub Issues for each user story
2. Set up a GitHub Project board with columns for Backlog, Sprint Backlog, In Progress, Review, and Done
3. Add user stories as cards to the Project board
4. Create GitHub Milestones for sprints
5. Link issues to milestones for the current sprint

## Conclusion

This Agile planning documentation provides a comprehensive roadmap for implementing the AI-Powered Smart Appointment Booking System using Agile methodology. The user stories, product backlog, and sprint plan ensure that development efforts are focused on delivering the highest value features first while maintaining alignment with stakeholder needs.
