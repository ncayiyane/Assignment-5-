## Prioritization Justification

### Must-have
Must-have stories represent core functionality without which the system would not be viable. These include:
- Core booking functionality (US-001, US-005, US-006, US-008)
- Essential security and compliance features (US-013)
- User management (US-011)
- Critical doctor-patient information flow (US-015)
- Appointment reminders to reduce no-shows (US-002)

### Should-have
Should-have stories represent important functionality that significantly enhances the system but isn't absolutely critical for initial launch:
- Calendar synchronization (US-003)
- Change notifications (US-007)
- Patient data management (US-009)
- System monitoring (US-012)

### Could-have
Could-have stories represent desirable features that would enhance the user experience but can be delivered in later iterations:
- Ratings and reviews (US-004)
- Reporting capabilities (US-010)
- Appointment history viewing (US-014)

### Effort Estimation Approach
- Story points use a 1-5 scale based on complexity and effort
- 1: Very simple, few hours of work
- 3: Moderate complexity, 1-2 days of work
- 5: Complex feature, 3+ days of work
- Estimates consider development, testing, and integration effort
