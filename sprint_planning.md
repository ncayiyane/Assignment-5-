Total Estimated Hours: 146

## Sprint Capacity
- 5 developers × 6 productive hours/day × 10 days = 300 hours
- Accounting for meetings, code reviews, and other activities: 300 × 0.7 = 210 available hours
- Sprint backlog requires 146 hours, which is within our capacity with buffer for unexpected issues

## MVP Contribution
This sprint delivers the core functionality needed for a viable appointment booking system:

1. **Patient-facing features:**
   - Online appointment booking
   - Appointment reminders

2. **Doctor-facing features:**
   - Availability management
   - Appointment dashboard

3. **System requirements:**
   - Data security and encryption

These features address the most critical pain points identified in previous assignments:
- Patients: Difficulty scheduling appointments and forgetting appointments
- Doctors: Managing availability and preparing for patient visits
- System: Meeting security and compliance requirements

Subsequent sprints will build upon this foundation to add additional features like calendar synchronization, reporting, and review capabilities.
